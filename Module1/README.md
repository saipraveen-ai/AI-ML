# Module 1: Foundations of AI and Machine Learning

## Overview
This module establishes a solid understanding of AI and Machine Learning (ML) concepts without delving deeply into Python syntax. It also introduces foundational concepts of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications.

## Topics Covered
- Overview of AI, ML, and Deep Learning
- Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
- Key Algorithms: Regression, Classification, Clustering
- Model Evaluation Metrics
- Introduction to AI and its applications
- Overview of Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Understanding transformers and attention mechanisms
- Tools and platforms for working with LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)
- **Using LangGraph for Generative AI and Autonomous Agents**

## Hands-On Activities
- Setting up your development environment
- Fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM
- **Building a simple generative AI model using LangGraph**
