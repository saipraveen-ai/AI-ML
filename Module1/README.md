# Module 1: Foundations of AI and LLMs

## Overview
This module introduces the foundational concepts of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). It also covers the use of LangGraph for creating generative AI language models and autonomous agents.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to AI and its applications
- Overview of Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Understanding transformers and attention mechanisms
- Tools and platforms for working with LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)
- **Using LangGraph for Generative AI and Autonomous Agents**

## Hands-On Activities
- Setting up your development environment
- Fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM
- **Building a simple generative AI model using LangGraph**
