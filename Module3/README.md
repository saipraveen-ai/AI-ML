# Module 3: Design Patterns for AI Systems

## Overview
This module covers common design patterns in AI systems and their application to LLM-based systems. It also demonstrates the use of tools like CrewAI, Perplexity AI, AutoGen, AutoGPT, and AutoDev for building efficient AI-driven digital workers.

## Topics Covered
- Common design patterns in AI (e.g., observer, factory, strategy)
- Applying design patterns to LLM-based systems
- Error handling and fault tolerance in AI workflows
- **Using CrewAI, Perplexity AI, AutoGen, AutoGPT, and AutoDev for AI-driven digital workers**

## Hands-On Activities
- Applying design patterns to a project
- **Building an AI-driven digital worker using AutoGPT**
